# Amazon Fine Food Reviews analysis using various ML Algorithms
Amazon Fine Food Reviews is a sentiment analysis problem in which the polarity of a new review is to be determined given a set of user reviews.
Given the user reviews, I have performed various preprocessing techniques on the dataset and also performed various text vectorization techniques on it.
I have applied various Supervised and Unsupervised learning techniques on the vectorized data and determined the polarity of a new review with good accuracy.
