      "For me, when the days get colder nothing is as rewarding as a simple cup of hot tea. And for it's claimed immunity benefits, a basic green tea is a common pick for maintaining a healthy natural balance during the flu season. From previous experiences in tasting the Tazo brand, both of the bottled and boxed products, they have proven to be unsurpassed for quality and flavor. Once I've tried their teas they immediately became my drink of choice. <p>The Zen Green Tea Blend is a wonderful one that has only a few ingredients with no artificial anything. And thankfully, doesn't boast the addition of fortified vitamins in some senseless amount. It truly is an enlightening blend of green tea, spearmint, lemongrass and lemon verbena. Thus making it versatile refreshment for anytime of the day, whether it's right after meals or between meals, or just before bedtime. Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever! I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being? I think it just could be the great taste and aroma and probably the reassuring thought of doing your health a favor.<br />Try a couple of their teas - they are sure to please!<br />And Tazo Zen Green Tea makes a good choice.\n",

      "Blend a little apple cider mix into your Tazo Passion Tea and see what happens. This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.<br /><br />Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "This is such a great film, I don't even know how to sum it up. First of  all, it is completely original and it is unlike any film I have ever seen  before. Second of all, it's a great comedy with kind of a spooky, weird  feel to it, which is something all of Tim Burton's films have. The look of  the film is probably what I like the best. Art Director Bo Welch and Tim  Burton show us a world unlike anything seen in a movie.  This is a great  film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable,  entertaining film that is original and inventive.\n",

The only thing  wrong was that it was too short. Maybe the special efects were a bit &quot;off&quot;, but hey, it's an older movie1\n",

      "Beetlejuice is the story of ghosts (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who can't get along with the family (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder) that moves into their house. The ghosts enlist Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) to help them, and the fun really starts. The movie is directed by Tim Burton. Robert Goulet and Dick Cavett make cameos. The score is by Danny Elfman. This movie has a great cast and a great director. <p>If you're a fan of Burton's other movies, you'll especially like this movie. Like all his movies, it has his distinctive look and feel to it. But anyone can enjoy this far-fetched comedy. Being PG, it should be appropriate for most members of the family. The DVD is lacking some of the special features that I would like to see though - like outtakes, behing-the-scenes, etc...\n",

      "If you've never tried Kona coffee, Aloha Island is definitely the one to start with.  <p>Kona coffee is grown in the Kona district of the Big Island and regarded by some to be the best coffee in the world.  I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare.\n",

Maybe they are ubiquitous, but Starbucks puts out a decent product and I can get a good cup in the a.m. and that's important.<p>The Breakfast Blend is a bit mild for my tastes (I like really STRONG coffee) but for guest and general consumption, this is a mild, aromatic coffee that is better than most.\n",

The 0610 gopher trap is easy to set and works  with great success. Also, remember to use a wire attached to the trap and  tie it to a steak to prevent gophers from dragging the trap further into  their hole once they are caught. I hope you find this product as easy to  use as i did, Good luck.\n",

      "See's Candies is a well-known San Francisco chocolate company, now with stores throughout the United States.  In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<p>Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box.\n",

      "I have enjoyed Hershey's chocolate bars from the time that I was a child.  My two favorites are Hershey's Dark Chocolate and Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds.  The combination of Hershey's sweet milk chocolate with chunks of whole almonds was a confectionary landmark that, in my opinion, only enhances the flavors of both.  Of course, being a bit weight conscious today, I don't eat Hershey's chocolate bars as often as I did in my childhood, but that doesn't alter my rating of them with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars!  Just be careful not to eat too many if, like me, you're concerned about your waistline.\n",

      "Sure why not. I've purchased plants via catalog for years and it can be frustrating to make the call and then find out that my first three choices are not in stock. Or worse, place the order and find out upon delivery that certain items were out of stock. I like that when purchasing from amazon I know whether or not there is inventory of a particular item before I make the purchase. I haven't pulled the trigger on one of these bonsai's yet, but I'm giving it 5 stars just for the effort. What's next, amazon, livestock?!\n",

      "If you've never tried Kona coffee, Aloha Island is definitely the one to start with.  <p>Kona coffee is grown in the Kona district of the Big Island and regarded by some to be the best coffee in the world.  I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare.\n",

Not the ones in the box but the ones in the long candy bar shaped package.  Those are the old ones and they taste different and have less flavors.  This was a bait and switch, no more no less.  I then had to order them again from a different seller, but had to call and make sure I was getting the new ones, in the box.  The news ones, shown in the picture are great.  They are excellent but I don't like the old ones, which is what I got after being deceived.\n",

      "I have never had black tea this good before.  I love lychee fruit and wanted some black tea for the caffeine content.  Problem is I do not like the taste of black tea.  This tea is different it is not bitter.  It is smooth in taste.  I do not add sugar to my teas so they have to stand on their own.  This one does.  That is why I purchase teas with flavors in them.  This may seem expensive, but realize this is 100 bags of tea and comes in a huge box.  If you look a regular tea it is a much smaller box.  This looks over three times the size.  Great tea try it for your caffenated tea.  It is wonderful tea.  This beats out earl gray or english breakfast tea in taste.  This tea is a pleasure to drink.  I just wanted to get some caffeine in a tolerable way with no artificial sweeteners or regular sugars.  This is it.  In the highly sweetened american culture there is a way out drink this tea from china.  It is calorie free with no artifical sweeteners. I am not asian, but I love asian products.\n",

      "What happens when you say his name three times? Michael Keaten stars in this comedy about two couples that live in an old two story house.  While coming back from a supply store, the couple suddenly get caught inside of a  &quot;broken-up&quot; bridge and then just before they start to tumble down  into the lake, a board catches them.  But just when they've got their hopes  up, and small dog steps on the board and the car starts to slide off the  bridge and into the lake waters.  A few minutes later...<p>They find  themselves back into their home, they find that somehow somehad light the  fireplace, as if done by magic.  From then on, they find a weird-looking  dead guy known as Bettlejuice.  The only way they can get him for help is  to call him by his name three times and he will appear at their survice.  But they soon wish that they have never called his name, because  Bettlejuice was once a troublemaker but he is the only one who can save  them, on the account that they said his name three times.  They can't leave  their houses or else they will find theirselves in another world with giant  sandworms.  This is a stellar comedy that you should see! Michael Keaton is  awesome as he plays the leading role of Bettlejuice.\n",

      "I decided to try this product because it was cheap and I'm usually a vanilla person. I love vanilla everything and because I had already tried the chocolate version and wanted a change I thought this would be perfect. Turns out it wasn't. The taste is horrible. Even thought there's no aspartame it tastes like there's artificial sweeteners in it. The first time I tried it it made me gag. The only way I was able to finish the box was to put it in my shaker and just take very big gulps without breathing. That way it was over in less than 30sec. I've tried the chocolate and at fist didn't like it, but this stuff makes the chocolate taste like candy. The chocolate tastes just like chocolate (more like hot cocoa), but without  added sugar. This stuff does not resemble vanilla ice cream at all.<br />  I'm not gonna completely bash it however, because how many protein shakes actually taste good? Despite the taste, it did what it was supposed to do. I drank one of these and it kept me full for three hours which is great for only 180cal. These shakes have helped me control my eating and keep me on my 1200cal a day diet (200 cal every 3 hours). I never experienced gas, bloating or any kind of stomach cramps. If you can get over the taste which won't last too long if you just gulp them down then this product isn't too bad. I would recommend trying the chocolate flavor, however. It tastes more natural. I have yet to try the strawberry.\n",

It is not over whelmingly hot, but nice.  I was happy to see there was no trans fat in the product.  My friend from Oklahoma said she liked these, but I could not find them.  Someone from Japan gave them to her.  She is really picky, so I thought if she liked them they must be great.  She is not really very experimental and I love all kinds of things.  I like them.  They are good.  I like them better than some of the more expesive wasabi snack products I have tried from eden foods.  I like the pea form.  These peas are addictive.

      "Quite frankly, we think this soup is disgusting.  There is no flavor to it whatsoever, and if I accidentally buy it, hoping a different flavor will be better, my husband (who eats ANYTHING!) just groans and chokes it down.  The only thing good about it is that it does have more \"stuff\" in it to fill you up, but just no taste.  After you dump about a pound of salt into them, they resemble something with some flavor, but not really.  It's healthy all right, but there are many other products out there that are just as healthy but have all the flavor as well.  If you don't like spices, then this is your soup.  However, since I make my own and we're more used to flavor, this one just doesn't cut the broth.\n",

It is not hot like \"Dave's\" or \"After Death\" or the other concentrates but it is about as close as you can get and still have really good flavor. It is the hottest sauce that you can find that actually tastes good.  If you are an experienced pepper lover that is tired of novelty sauces that taste like cardboard this is a must try.

      "i have not purchased this product, yet.  i doubt i will purchase it through amazon since it takes way to long to even be shipped out.  it says \"Usually ships within 2 to 4 weeks.\"  in less time than that, i can go to a local store and have them order it directly for me to purchase.<br /><br />second problem i have with this is math related.  its my understanding there are 16 ounces to a pound.  these are sold in 12 ounce units which is just fine.  the problem i do find is this, \"Shipping Weight: 1.9 pounds\" and \"Ghirardelli Caffe Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Caramel, Light Roast Whole Bean Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)\"<br /><br />so, 12 oz time 3 packages equals 36 oz.  2 pounds is 32 oz.  so how is it that if i order this three pack of 12 oz bags of coffee beans, i would receive a package that weighs less than two pounds for product that is supposed to weigh over 2 pounds?<br /><br />i am confused by too many things having to do with ordering any consumable products from amazon's Grocery & Gourmet Food section.  but this is one item i really wanted to try and i wish i could just send a message to the seller, but that link isnt on the product profile.  honestly, im noticing that link is missing from more and more product profiles.  i take it amazon only wants people to contact sellers about their merch after they have purchased it.  that sucks, cause the info i get from profiles, reviews, and contacting the seller before purchase if needed, is what helps me to determine if i will enjoy the product im thinking of buying, if the product will be worth its cost, and how well various products work in various situations.<br /><br />this coffee, i would course grind and use in a press if i were to buy it.  thing is, i want more info.  i want numbers to add up properly and if i order something, to get what i pay for.  when i order something, i want it shipped within 3 to 4 days or less, not weeks later.  i know amazon has a shopping system for consumables that allows you to order a quantity and have it reordered automatically after the selected time of your choosing.  but this is insane, its not like im pre-ordering a book, movie, game, cd before it goes on sale.<br /><br />sorry for my bitching.  this coffee sounds like it will taste wonderful.  i just wont be purchasing it through amazon because of too many little things that dont make sense or add up.<br /><br />thank you for your time and putting up with my ramblings.\n",

The colors are more intense, and you can easily blend lovely shades for your icings. <p>Martha Stewart shows wonderful seasonal cookies from time to time on her TV show. A simple eggwhite-sugar icing on cookies in exciting colors makes such a wonderful table decoration as well as great dessert for parties, teas and other events.

My understanding from the way the product was described is that there were 24 cases of 6 bottles, not 24 bottles total.  At 24 bottles total (which is what I received), this is a worse price than what I pay at my grocery store (which is the most expensive place I have bought them).\n",

      "The wine saver is great in so many ways. Obviously it's wonderful to be able to open a bottle of wine and have it stay good for a day or two, especially if you just like one glass with dinner. This lets you open up and enjoy more expensive wine since you won't waste the whole rest of the bottle. If you are interested in learning about wines, you'll probably want to open up 2 or more wines at a time to compare them, and this way you won't waste anything. The wine saver will keep the undrunk portion until the next time.  I do recommend putting the bottle in the fridge if you don't drink it the next day. Just pull the bottle out an hour before you want to drink it if it's red.\n",

      "I drink a lot of iced tea but not if it isn't sweet.  I thought these individual packets would be good for adding to my tea and I'm glad to have something that won't spike my insulin levels.  One packet is worth about two sugar packets so be careful how much you use.  I think sugar tastes good, aspartame tastes good, sucralose (e.g. Splenda) tastes good, saccharin tastes good (when you don't overdo it) but this was just weird.  It was sweet for sure, but it seems like most of the sweetness didn't register until a few seconds later.  I also registered an almost bitter taste, but just for a split second with each sip.  It's really hard for me to explain, but I'll just say I had no desire to finish the rest of my iced tea.<br /><br />I tried it again later and did a few experiments with it.  First, I poured a little on my finger and tasted it by itself.  Again I thought it had kind of an odd taste and slightly bitter.  I poured a slightly larger portion on my finger and tasted that.  Yuck!  Maybe it's like that because it's sweeter than sugar, but I got the same sensation when I mixed it in my tea.  I also tried adding it gradually to my tea and the best I could do was a neutral flavor.  Once it started to get sweet I could taste that same funny and slightly bitter taste.  Another wasted glass.<br /><br />This is the first stevia product I've tried so I can't say the sweetener itself tastes like this, they do add other ingredients.  If you want to try this product you really need to get the cheapest/smallest that you can.  I'll be throwing out about 95% of this stuff and I'm regretting that I ever used 5% of it.<br /><br />I would, however, recommend agave nectar.  It's a low-calorie sweetener with a low glycemic index and it's natural (usually organic).  It has a smooth taste, a pleasant aftertaste [if any], and even when I use too much it doesn't taste terrible.  I've tried two different brands and I have yet to be disappointed.\n",

      "Panko bread crumbs are just awesome.  When used for breading they make a light yet crispy coating...The are different than traditional *american type* crumbs in the way that soft powder snow is different than heavy packed snow.  <p>The crumbs themselves are larger and irregularly shaped so as they lie on eachother they don't form a dense compressed breading but one with substance that still remains airy.  Their flavor is very light and seasoning is needed but this is a plus for me as I can season to taste.<p>I have also mixed these with traditional bread crumbs at times as these tend to be expensive for a lighter style coating but still essentially very much like all panko dishes.  I tend to use a light egg wash with these as I find using just eggs to dip the meat/poulty/fish in a bit heavy for these crumbs.  <p>In general I find these far superior for coating food.  These aren't the kind of bread crumbs I use for adding bulk (ie meatloaf, meatballs etc).  I have been using these for a few years now an there is a huge difference between these and the others.  I think if you try them you will really enjoy the light crisp crusts you can achieve...\n",

I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare.\n",

      "For me, when the days get colder nothing is as rewarding as a simple cup of hot tea. And for it's claimed immunity benefits, a basic green tea is a common pick for maintaining a healthy natural balance during the flu season. From previous experiences in tasting the Tazo brand, both of the bottled and boxed products, they have proven to be unsurpassed for quality and flavor. Once I've tried their teas they immediately became my drink of choice. <p>The Zen Green Tea Blend is a wonderful one that has only a few ingredients with no artificial anything. And thankfully, doesn't boast the addition of fortified vitamins in some senseless amount. It truly is an enlightening blend of green tea, spearmint, lemongrass and lemon verbena. Thus making it versatile refreshment for anytime of the day, whether it's right after meals or between meals, or just before bedtime. Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever! I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being? I think it just could be the great taste and aroma and probably the reassuring thought of doing your health a favor.<br />Try a couple of their teas - they are sure to please!<br />And Tazo Zen Green Tea makes a good choice.\n",

This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.<br /><br />Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon.

      "I've bought a couple of these for my Airedale puppy who constantly wants to chew.  These things are amazing in that they have bone, tendon, meat, and knuckles still attached.  She dives in and tears it apart - she would work on it non-stop if I didn't periodically take it away from her.  The meat and tendons are harmless enough - obviously they have fat and protein so they have to be tied into diet considerations, and the bone appears to hold onto the flavor long after it's stripped (she still licks and gnaws on a bone that's a few weeks bare).  The knuckles, once they get torn off, should probably be thrown away after a few minutes because they are small enough to be swallowed and/or choked on.  The only downside to this product is when she comes up to me and the whiskers around her mouth are a little discolored and she smells like roasted meat.  But, well worth it if you want to give your dog a treat that they can't get enough of.\n",

Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable.  Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!

      "Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper \"tab\" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a \"best if used by\" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.\n",

      "After years of using Starbuck's decaf and regular single serving espresso pods, I finally found a substitute that's more economical and MUCH better tasting.<p>I've used three different brands of pods in my Starbuck's Barista machine, and have found that the quality of the pod and the flavor of the espresso inside is, by far, the best in the Espressione pods. The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.<p>Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.<p>The tab on each pod is also handy, making it easier to switch out a hot spent pod with a new one when making a second round of espresso.\n",

      "I have relied on these cake mixes for a few years and find them to be handy and to taste fine.  As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.  The cake mixes only require water to make.  The first lemon flavored Sweet `N Low cake I made was adequate but did not have any fresh tart lemon flavor.  The next time I tried using half lemon juice and half water and something very strange happened to the texture, it felt like a sponge.  Not a sponge cake but a dish sponge.  I keep trying to find the right amount of lemon juice to add and have not hit on it yet.  If you do not mind a mild and slightly artificial lemon flavor, than this is a great product.  For first time users I wish that the product description here specified that these mixes make a single thin eight-inch layer.  My local grocery store sells the mixes for $2.79 and rarely has flavors other than chocolate or yellow so the price and variety offered here is wonderful news.\n",

This movie is hilariously funny, but at the same time it has a touch of drama in it. It's an all around great movie.<p>Michael Keaton does an excellent job of playing the odd, funny, and perverted Beetlejuice who causes quite the chaos with a newly deceased couple, Adam and Barbara. Let me just say no one and I mean NO ONE could've been better for the part of Beetlejuice.<p>The only disapointting thing about the DVD Beetljuice is there were no deleted scenes or extra footage.. I was disapointed, but I love this movie so much it was still worth it!<p>If you haven't seen Beetlejuice, then YOU MUST SEE IT.

      "Although I love the convenience of this coffee maker, I have been very disappointed by the flavor of the decaf coffee.  The coffee brews beautifully, creating an appealing frothy \"crema\" at the top.  However, the coffee itself is very bland.<br /><br />I keep hoping that Senseo will introduce a \"bold\" decaf option.  My husband, who drinks caffeinated coffee, quite enjoys their \"bold\" coffee pods.  In the meanwhile, I circumvent the problem by using two decaf coffee pods, while selecting the one cup option.  It concentrates the coffee, which significantly improves the flavor.  It bothers me, though, that I'm paying \"twice\" for one cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the reviews, it seems like a lot of people enjoy the decaf coffee, as it is.  However, if you enjoy a more intense, bold tasting coffee, you will need to use two pods to get some approximation of a distinct coffee flavor.\n",

      "Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper \"tab\" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a \"best if used by\" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.\n",

      "It's hard to review something like a snack bar because a lot of time it comes down to things like personal taste and preferences, but I'll try to do it as much justice as I can<br /><br />The strawberry soy joy bar has a texture that reminds me of a dense version of a nutrigrain bar, minus the filling.  It's full of fruit chunks and has a strong, fruity floral flavor.<br /><br />What I like most about these bars is that their 130 calories make them perfect for a snack, unlike many bars that are higher in calories and fat and more of a meal replacement.  It also has 3 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein which I consider sufficient for a snack.  They do a relatively good job of tiding me over until the next meal or beating the afternoon munchies.<br /><br />That said, there are some things I do not care for, which are the reason I give them 3 stars.  The first is that visually they seem incredibly tiny for the calorie count, which makes them less satisfying in a way.  I compared them to my typical Luna bar and was surprised to find it was only 50% bigger (weight wise) than the Soy Joy bar.  Visually it looks much bigger but I'm wondering if this has to do with how dense the Soy Joy bar is.  The second is that I didn't really care for the flavor.  It was too sweet compared to things like a Luna, Odwalla, or Lara Bar, but probably on par with something like a Nutrigrain bar.  I also couldn't really tell that the flavor was strawberry.  It mostly just tasted sugary.  There were also a lot of ingredients in the bar that I couldn't taste at all.  The label mentions chocolate chips and pineapple but I couldn't taste these at all, just a generic kind of sweetness.<br /><br />Another thing worth noting is that it is not enriched with any vitamins like a lot of meal and snack bars.  This isn't a concern to me since I attempt to eat a varied and balanced diet, but does make this bar different than something like a Luna Bar that is typically enriched with a lot of vitamins and minerals.  Overall this just wasn't a bar I cared for very much.  It seemed so small for the number of calories and just tasted generically sweet and dense.<br /><br />The bottom line is that taste is subjective and you may like these bars even if I do not.  However, in my opinion I find the flavors of bars like Luna and Odwalla to be closer to what the description says and more satisfying overall.  However if you don't care for those bars and are looking for something different this may be closer to what you are looking for.\n",

      "See's Candies is a well-known San Francisco chocolate company, now with stores throughout the United States.  In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<p>Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box.\n",

      "These tomatoes are domestically grown in CA. To the person who said that they didn't know how anyone can tell where they're from, read the product description written by the manufacturer. It says \"these are domestically grown tomatoes...\", it also says \"grown in California\" right on the label.<br /><br />To the person who said he had tasted them, and referred to another reviewers comments and said that person had not tasted them, please reread the review. He clearly states that he had tasted them.<br /><br />As for me, I have cooked with these many times, because they were on sale at my local Safeway. They are definitely NOT the real deal! They do not look like, nor taste like real San Marzano tomatoes grown in Italy- which I have tasted and cooked with many times. They taste like any other run of the mill American grocery store brand. I agree with the 1st reviewer that their labels are false advertising, and the price they charge on Amazon is highway robbery! $4.50 + shipping- ouch! I paid about $1 per 28 oz. can (on sale) at my local market. Save your time and money- if you are looking for the real deal, this is not it. There are websites that sell nothing but real Italian products, grown in Italy, and stamped with the official Italian DOP seal.<br /><br />Nancy\n",

The flavors are varied and he doesn't get tired or bored with the tastes.  You can also divide the treats in half to make them smaller and I use them that way both inside the treat ball and as training treats.  This is a great product which comes packaged in a zip-lock foil bag so the treats stay fresh for a long period of time...if you can keep them away from your dog long enough!

While coming back from a supply store, the couple suddenly get caught inside of a  &quot;broken-up&quot; bridge and then just before they start to tumble down  into the lake, a board catches them.  But just when they've got their hopes  up, and small dog steps on the board and the car starts to slide off the  bridge and into the lake waters.  A few minutes later...<p>They find  themselves back into their home, they find that somehow somehad light the  fireplace, as if done by magic.  From then on, they find a weird-looking  dead guy known as Bettlejuice.  The only way they can get him for help is  to call him by his name three times and he will appear at their survice.  But they soon wish that they have never called his name, because  Bettlejuice was once a troublemaker but he is the only one who can save  them, on the account that they said his name three times.  They can't leave  their houses or else they will find theirselves in another world with giant  sandworms.  This is a stellar comedy that you should see! Michael Keaton is  awesome as he plays the leading role of Bettlejuice.\n",

      "The wine saver is great in so many ways. Obviously it's wonderful to be able to open a bottle of wine and have it stay good for a day or two, especially if you just like one glass with dinner. This lets you open up and enjoy more expensive wine since you won't waste the whole rest of the bottle. If you are interested in learning about wines, you'll probably want to open up 2 or more wines at a time to compare them, and this way you won't waste anything. The wine saver will keep the undrunk portion until the next time.  I do recommend putting the bottle in the fridge if you don't drink it the next day. Just pull the bottle out an hour before you want to drink it if it's red.\n",

      "I like these a lot.  They are only slightly salty, with a bit of molasses sweetness, all balanced against a mild licorice flavor.  They are medium-hard and very chewy, although they must be kept in an airtight container or they get too hard.  Personally I would prefer a stronger licorice flavor, but these are still among my favorites.<br /><br />Salty licorice is indeed a strange thing for those who haven't tried it before.  If you've never had it before, don't start with a case (like what's sold here).  And definitely stay away from Double Salt licorice until you've learned whether you like the saltiness.<br /><br />If you want black licorice but don't want the salty flavor, try \"Haribo licorice wheels\". Those have more licorice flavor than these coins, and less other flavor.  They're a bit sweet and a bit softer.<br /><br />Note that these coins also come in bags.  Buying them that way is slightly more cost-effective, but the tubs might be a little more airtight.\n",

      "Beetlejuice is not a movie that you can't watch under . . . 5,000 times! It is one of the funiest movies ever made, mixing a strange reality to the story, along with a romance between Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. The funny thing about this story is  the strange world between the living and the dead, and the recently deceased handbook, ha. You have to wait in your house for 125 years, while haunting the people that come in, and trying not to break your cover, and in the story, that is why hauntings take place. Tim Burton did an excellent job, and you have to see this movie.\n",

      "****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />****\n",

I thought it was hopeless until I read the reviews of Pamela's Amazing Wheat-Free Bread Mix.  I decided to give it a shot, so I borrowed my sister-in-law's bread machine and fired up a loaf.<br /><br />Simply put, I was amazed at the results.  Does it taste like regular bread?  No.  Well, almost.  Is it light-years beyond any other gluten-free breads?  A hearty, resounding YES!  If you've eaten other gluten-free (GF) breads before, let me give you a comparison: it holds up better than pre-made GF bread, but it still feels like it could fall apart easily.  Putting a slice in the toaster helps with that.  It's a little on the chewy side.  It tastes like it doesn't have any salt in it, so adding some butter really helps.  It kind of looks like banana bread, if I were to compare textures.  Make sure to have some milk on-hand because it makes you pretty thirsty when you eat it!<br /><br />I would say this is 90% - 95% as good as \"real\" bread.  Thank goodness, my search for wheat-free bread is over!  And Amazon sells it for nearly half the price as my local health food stores!  If you're the only gluten-intolerant or Celiac in your family, I would recommend picking up a bread machine.  It makes one loaf automatically.  All I did was to follow the direction on the package and the loaf came out perfectly.  It was as simple as dumping the ingredients in the machine, making sure the settings were right, and hitting the \"On\" button.  So easy, even a caveman could do it!  I put the bread machine to work at about 9pm at night and woke up the next morning to freshly-baked GLUTEN-FREE bread.  EDIBLE bread.  Awesome!  I used a older Zojirushi machine, but some of the newer models like from Breadman actually have a Gluten-Free setting on them.  There is hope for decent-tasting bread for us gluten-intolerant people!  THANK YOU Pamela's Products!!\n",

      "This are so much easier to use than the Wilson paste colors.  Colors are  vibrant, and do not taint the frosting like some colors can.  These are  simple to use, and do not make a mess.  My only complaint is that I did not  find these years ago.  This is a must have if you decorate often!\n",

      "I purchased a bag of this product which cost about $20 with shipping. The bag isn't quite as big as buying a bag of regular sugar,so in comparison, it's really expensive. That wouldn't bother me if I had been more pleased with it, but it really IS NOT just like sugar.. It's not as sweet at all and just doesn't work that great for baking, which is what I purchased it for. My husband is diabetic and really misses cookies, and we don't want to use any of the artificail sweetners on the market because of all the health hazards connected to them. But Just Like Sugar is not the answer. I made one batch of oatmeal cookies, one pan of brownies and one batch of no bake cookies with this one bag of product, so it cost almost $7 per batch for the sweetner!!! The oatmeal cookies were just so so.. not bad, but not great.. definatly not as sweet as they should have been and they had a different kind of texture.. I'm not quite sure how to describe it..Kind of grainy... The brownies, horrible!! A recipe that normally makes delicious brownies turned out flat and not very tasty. We ate one brownie each and threw the rest out. The no bake cookies were ok, probably the best out of the three recipes, but still not that great... My package of Just Like Sugar also included a small sample of the Just Like Brown Sugar.. I put it on my oatmeal but could barely tell there was any sugar on it..<br />All in all, I guess if you have no alternative it's better than nothing, but I won't ever purchase it again.. I'll stick to Stevia, which is also a natural product and is super duper sweet! I thought the Just Like Sugar would be more convenient because the makers of it claim you use the very same amount in recipes as real sugar, and with Stevia, there's a lot of conversion.. But the claims just aren't true... You'd need to use quite a bit more of the Just Like Sugar in order to have the same sweetness as sugar. Very dissapointing.. After all the hoopla about this product and supposed feedback from happy customers, it just simply doesn't live up to the claims.\n",

      "Beetlejuice is an excellent and funny movie. Keaton is hilarious as the wacky beetlejuice. The great special effects help the film. I think this is one of the best movies ever made and I'm sure you'll agree. For a good  time, watch beetlejuice!\n",

I like that when purchasing from amazon I know whether or not there is inventory of a particular item before I make the purchase.

      "For years I have been trying to simulate a truly Italian espresso or cappuccino without success.  Several packages arrived [...] just before Christmas.  My son had sent a Briel Cadiz Espresso machine, two lovely Russian china cups and a case of Espressione Classic Espresso Pods.  It was the kindest, most wonderful Christmas present I can remember.  The espresso machine excels in quality and ease of use.  The espresso is exquisite.  Each time I prepare an espresso or cappuccino I experience my son's loving kindness and a small part of the many gifts of Italy.  Heaven on Earth.\n",

      "Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper \"tab\" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a \"best if used by\" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.\n",

      "The spectra paste food colors are simply fantastic. They provide a depth and clarity of color that is impossible to achieve with liquid food colors. And the hues are beautiful and distinctive. The black and red, two colors which are very difficult to get when dying frostings, etc. are especially nice - probably the best of any manufacturer I have tried.<p>For those who had questions, I am not 100% certain about the sizes, but if the set is the same as mine, the bottles are 3/4 ounce. While that might not seem like much, all you need is a dot of this thick gel paste at the end of a toothpick to color large amounts of material. So there is plenty of coloring ability in each bottle - many, many times more than a same sized liquid food color bottle. <p>Highly recommended and at a really good price at the time of this review.\n",

      "For me, when the days get colder nothing is as rewarding as a simple cup of hot tea. And for it's claimed immunity benefits, a basic green tea is a common pick for maintaining a healthy natural balance during the flu season. From previous experiences in tasting the Tazo brand, both of the bottled and boxed products, they have proven to be unsurpassed for quality and flavor. Once I've tried their teas they immediately became my drink of choice. <p>The Zen Green Tea Blend is a wonderful one that has only a few ingredients with no artificial anything. And thankfully, doesn't boast the addition of fortified vitamins in some senseless amount. It truly is an enlightening blend of green tea, spearmint, lemongrass and lemon verbena. Thus making it versatile refreshment for anytime of the day, whether it's right after meals or between meals, or just before bedtime. Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever! I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being? I think it just could be the great taste and aroma and probably the reassuring thought of doing your health a favor.<br />Try a couple of their teas - they are sure to please!<br />And Tazo Zen Green Tea makes a good choice.\n",

      "Quinoa is one of the healthiest grains you can eat - and one of the most delicious!  It cooks in less than 15 minutes, so you can make a fast dinner using it.  And how delicious it is!  Mmmmmmm!!!!  Softer than rice, it has a slightly sweet and nutty taste.  My favorite recipe is to cook it with a small onion, a tablespoon of butter, and a half cube of vegetarian boullion (or a half-teaspoon if using powdered boullion or fresh refrigerated type).  Bring the water to a boil, add the onion, butter, let boil for a minute.  Then add the quinoa.  Bring to boil again.  Add the bullion, and turn down to a low simmer for 10 - 15 minutes, and there you go!  A fantastic grain that leaves you feeling light and energetic.  As for Bob's products, they are always excellent.  Amazon's price is very good, especially if you live in a small town or out in the country, where it may be hard to get organic and specialty items like Bob's Quinoa.\n",

It tastes like somehow it sat out far too long and soured.. of course this is honey so it's not possible, it's just the natural taste of the honey. Like the bees took it straight from ivy and bark.<br />I most commonly use honey for my tea in the morning and the rancid portion of this honey is so overwhelming that it ruins the tea, so I tried using it for cooking thinking that would be better, so I baked banana bread with it, after it came out of the oven I couldn't even taste the banana, the honey completely overpowered everything else.<br />Now I'm stuck with five unopened bottles of this useless honey, what now?\n",

The colors are more intense, and you can easily blend lovely shades for your icings. <p>Martha Stewart shows wonderful seasonal cookies from time to time on her TV show. A simple eggwhite-sugar icing on cookies in exciting colors makes such a wonderful table decoration as well as great dessert for parties, teas and other events. These paste colors are a must if you like to make frosted cookies or party cakes. <p>And these are especially fun if you have kids. A cookie-icing contest is a fun event for a birthday party, Christmas party or just a rainy afternoon.\n",

      "I ordered these snacks because I had tried the apple cinnamon kind and loved them so much. The apples were crispy and delicious and the nutrition information was very reasonable with low calories, no fat, and high fiber. Based on the strength of the apple snacks, I went ahead and ordered the bake-dried mangos. And because I love mangos, I ordered a lot--35 dollars worth to be exact.<br />Imagine my dissapointment when I finally got the snacks and they were nothing like the apples. Instead of being crispy and light, they have a tough leathery texture that is completely unappealing. Worse, they have a strange, bitter aftertaste that lingers in the mouth after you eat some. No one in my house wants anything to do with these extremely nasty snacks. Even my son, who loves all kinds of dried fruit, won't touch them.<br />What a waste of money! I will never order from this company again. Buyer beware.\n",

      "This is such a great film, I don't even know how to sum it up. First of  all, it is completely original and it is unlike any film I have ever seen  before. Second of all, it's a great comedy with kind of a spooky, weird  feel to it, which is something all of Tim Burton's films have. The look of  the film is probably what I like the best. Art Director Bo Welch and Tim  Burton show us a world unlike anything seen in a movie.  This is a great  film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable,  entertaining film that is original and inventive.\n",

      "Ok this is my first review so bear with. This product is so good I had to share my thoughts about it. First off let me say that I am Italian. I have chosen to go low carb in the past with much success. The only problem is, is no pasta. That's a really big thing for an Italian. I can go without the bread, potatoe, rice, and sweets no problem. But when it comes to pasta, that hit me really hard. So I go to Amazon to order it after hearing from a friend of mine how good it is. I am also one of those people who have tried every other low carb pasta on the market and thought they all tasted like cardboard. Yuk! I recieved Dreamfields and the same night made some to go with my dinner. To my surprise this stuff was heaven. I know other reviewers say to only eat this as a treat to yourself, but I eat it maybe 3 or 4 times a week. I am still loosing weight. Actually loosing at a faster rait than before for some reason. Now I am not diabetic so I do not have to watch my sugar spike levels.I don't even really watch my portion. I plate what I think will fill me and that is that.Probly 2 to 3 portions (1/2 cup is one portion). I never have that bloated feeling I used to get after eating a plate of normal pasta.And I never get the sugar carb crash 2 hours later. It has been almost 2 months of eating this pasta whenever I feel like it. The freedom is great.I have also made this pasta in several different ways. Macaroni and cheese, Alfredo style, garlic and butter with roasted veggies, you name it. Now I like my pasta \"al dente\" meaning almost cooked. They say you should not over cook the pasta because it will change the way it digests. Doesn't bother me I like it just on the chewy side of done. As far as reheating it, well just make sure you cook it al dente and when it comes time to reheating it should still be fine. Soups maybe a problem though since the pasta stays in the soup liquid and reheating to many time can cause the pasta to go mushy. So please do yourself a favor and either get Dreamfields from Amazon or from some of the local grocerie stores. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!\n",

      "Introduced to Leonidas several years ago, on successive trips to Brussels I returned with the two other, more well-known brands (Godiva and Neuhaus), when I couldn't get to Leonidas before my plane left. My wife advised me that in the future it was Leonidas or nothing.<br /><br />They are machine-made so the price is not bad (as opposed to the hand-made varieties), but they are also made fresh without preservatives so they need to be eaten or refrigerated quickly. In this house, the refrigerator rarely sees the package.<br /><br />They are excellent and a treat you owe yourself.\n",

      "I contacted Lil' Critters customer service several times to request that they provide test results for the mercury levels in their Omega-3 supplements.  With some relatively recent news suggesting that actual levels were higher than those reported for some manufacturers, I was concerned about what amounts my kids were ingesting.<br /><br />My initial request for information was responded to with someone in their customer service organization named Hollie who essentially said the same thing their website does - that these are tested very carefully and that they are safe.  I requested that she forward the test results.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />I waited a couple of weeks and asked again.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />I asked again, indicating I wanted to continue purchasing these items from Costco if I was satisfied with the results and that I did not want to post my concerns in a public forum.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />Given they are marketing these items for consumption by young kids at an age where their bodies and brains are so dependent upon proper nutrition, I would think a manufacturer with faith in their products would respond to a customer request pretty promptly.<br /><br />They haven't.  So I will be switching to another manufacturer who is a little more transparent with their product information.<br /><br />Update on August 9, 2010<br /><br />For those of you who have read the post that these gummy bears only contain plant-based ingredients, please check the container for yourself.  On the one I have, it says in bold italics underneath the ingredients list that the product DOES CONTAIN FISH!  Specifically, the product contains anchovy, sardine, mackerel and tuna.<br /><br />Note that the Environmental Defense Fund has a list [...] which outlines their recommendations for the maximum number of servings of various fish species that kids should have per month.<br /><br />Mackerel and tuna are on this list and are almost unsafe at any consumption level.<br /><br />In my view, this product should not be trusted unless the company provides testing results, and as far as I can tell, they have not done that.<br /><br />Update on August 15, 2010<br /><br />I just received my first shipment of Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Gummies, and my kids love them.  No fishy taste whatsoever!  They test their products vigorously and meet more stringent European standards for contaminant levels.  Yes, they are more expensive, but having the peace of mind of a better product is worth the expense.  Check them out.\n",

      "I purchased this as an alternative to the popular Japanese furikake because the Asian version incorporates sugar in all of their varieties, which I don't like. However, my glee at finding a sugarless version was soon cut short once I was able to inspect the contents in person. The ingredient list boasts of sesame seeds, seaweed, and pickled shiso leaves, but the last two ingredients are so disproportionate as to negate the necessity of even listing them except to highlight possible allergens.<br /><br />Seasame seeds, sesame seeds...both black and traditional versions...with a flake here or two that might be seaweed. Not that my tastebuds could tell. You're honestly just better off buying a bottle of sesame seeds and tossing in a sprinkle of salt.<br /><br />While not a direct commentary on the company itself (I really like their umeboshi), I think it's sad that they felt the need to Westernize this delightful condiment by eliminating or reducing the tastiest parts.\n",

      "I'm not a fan of this coffee at all. It has a harsh flavor, and the hazelnut flavor doesn't even seem very accurate to what hazelnut should be like. It makes me think of chemicals - like they mixed together a few artificial additives and hoped it would come close to hazelnut. When I throw the used grounds in the garbage, the smell permeates the entire room with a weird buttery smell for days. I know that's not really relevant to the coffee's taste, and I could empty the garbage every day (yeah right), but thought it a funny odd note worth mentioning.<br />I've compared this coffee with Starbucks Espresso blend (brewed from grounds, in the same device I use with the Millstone grounds) and the Starbucks espresso is leagues above this. I'm not saying Millstone is terrible - it is still drinkable - just that it's like a 4 on a 10 point scale; and when there are other coffees in the grocery store that are 8 or 9 on the taste scale and only cost $1 or $2 more per pound, I don't see a reason to buy the Millstone hazelnut cream.\n",

      "I'll start off by saying that I don't care that these are Kosher.  I bought them because I could get marshmallows in bulk for a gift idea. That said, I'll start with the good.  These marshmallows are longer and skinnier than store-bought.  They have a very pleasant vanilla scent to them as well.  Holding them, they are nice and squishable and if you need to rip them into bits, they're not as gooey-sticky as store bought.<br /><br />As for the bad, I tried these out plain and in hot cocoa.  Raw, they taste and feel like puffy sugar. When half melted in my drink, the sugar crystals really took over and I felt like I was eating sugary grit.  Kids might like this, but if you're expecting a soft, light marshmallow fluff sensation in your drink, either make your own or stick with store-bought.  Because of this, I probably would not buy these again and I most likely will not use these for my gifts.<br /><br />Extra information: Yes, these marshmallows state they are pork free, but to get the gelatin they needed, fish products were used instead.\n",

The cereal came in a big box, the contents where okay - though dinged around the edges, and the shipping time was a little slower than I usually get for packages.

If you can be patient, certain cereals always seems to go on sale and this is one of them. Just yesterday I saw 3 17.5oz boxes for $6.00.  Wow.<br /><br />Since the idea is to save on costs from volume purchasing, the idea failed.  Without the coupon, this food buy was not a good deal at all. One by one I saw all the products offered and all the ones I bought become sale items that were significantly less expensive - we're talking in the 45% range here.  I suppose, if you are in a remote area where the gas cost would eat the savings of finding a good price, this would be a decent service. But anyone in a suburban or urban setting will get a better deal at the Kroger's or Ralphs than this.\n",

      "See's Candies is a well-known San Francisco chocolate company, now with stores throughout the United States.  In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<p>Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box.\n",

      "To give you a bit of background, I drink tea every single day, several times a day.  Not your typical American bag tea, but loose tea.  I like the variety of flavors available in loose teas.  I enjoy Rooibos and other herbal teas, White teas, Green teas, and Black teas.  Basically, I should own stock in Teavana since I drink so much of their tea.  I also found a phenomenal tea from Stockholm.  These teas are much better than your standard Orange Pekoe and Black or bagged teas in Starbucks or my local grocer.  That said, this product intrigued me and I figured I would give it a chance.  We only brewed it straight in our drip coffee maker.  No foam and such that was shown on the package...Here are the pros and cons we found:<br /><br />Pros:<br />*health benefits - but I get that with the teas I already drink<br />*seems easier to get more concentrated flavor (if you want that)<br />*Cappuccino or other methods could be good if you're trying to replace coffee with healthier alternative (I still would just opt for loose tea since the deep, rich flavor of coffee isn't \"there\" with this product.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />*flavor was ok, a bit heavy, not spectacular (on the other hand, the teas I drink each day are complex, varied in taste, and refreshing)<br />*texture was off - usually I don't think of teas as having much of a texture but there was a definite difference due to the ground nature of this product - felt \"off\"<br />*It reminded me of how creamed corn is the leftovers.  I wonder if the leaves used to make this were so small they were ground up in hopes of still making a profit.  I could be wrong or pessimistic...\n",

      "For me, when the days get colder nothing is as rewarding as a simple cup of hot tea. And for it's claimed immunity benefits, a basic green tea is a common pick for maintaining a healthy natural balance during the flu season. From previous experiences in tasting the Tazo brand, both of the bottled and boxed products, they have proven to be unsurpassed for quality and flavor. Once I've tried their teas they immediately became my drink of choice. <p>The Zen Green Tea Blend is a wonderful one that has only a few ingredients with no artificial anything. And thankfully, doesn't boast the addition of fortified vitamins in some senseless amount. It truly is an enlightening blend of green tea, spearmint, lemongrass and lemon verbena. Thus making it versatile refreshment for anytime of the day, whether it's right after meals or between meals, or just before bedtime. Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever! I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being? I think it just could be the great taste and aroma and probably the reassuring thought of doing your health a favor.<br />Try a couple of their teas - they are sure to please!<br />And Tazo Zen Green Tea makes a good choice.\n",

      "After years of hiding flavored liquid heart meds in my cat's treat food, the dreaded day arrived: the only way I could be sure of his swallowing all the meds was to pill him. My cat threatened to take me to divorce court; my savvy neighbor gave me some Pill Pockets to try, and from that day on, the living was easy! I enclosed up to five different pill pieces in one yummy chicken Pill Pocket, wet it to slide easier, and in one second pushed the entire treat down his throat. No bitter taste, no pills spit out later under the table, not even any resentful looks from my baby. And no guilt for me, as I knew the Pockets are made up of only healthy, fresh ingredients. The best part was that our relationship stayed great, while I knew all of his meds were properly ingested. I can't recomend this product highly enough; and buying it from Amazon rather than my vet saved me 2/3 of the cost.\n",

      "I bought a few of these after my apartment was infested with fruit flies. After only a few hours, the trap had &quot;attracted&quot; many flies and within a few days they were practically gone. This may not be a long term  solution, but if flies are driving you crazy, consider buying this. One  caution- the surface is very sticky, so try to avoid touching it.\n",

      "I have relied on these cake mixes for a few years and find them to be handy and to taste fine.  As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.  The cake mixes only require water to make. A teaspoon of real vanilla or almond extract improves the flavor.  I like to make the chocolate cake with iced coffee.  Then rather than use sugar free frosting (ugggh!) I sprinkle the top with either unsweetened cocoa or with chopped coffee beans.  The bitterness of the cocoa and the coffee beans enhances the sweetness of the cake. These mixes make a very thin eight-inch layer.  My local grocery store sells the mixes for $2.79 and rarely has flavors other than chocolate or yellow so the price and variety offered here is wonderful news.\n",

      "For me, when the days get colder nothing is as rewarding as a simple cup of hot tea. And for it's claimed immunity benefits, a basic green tea is a common pick for maintaining a healthy natural balance during the flu season. From previous experiences in tasting the Tazo brand, both of the bottled and boxed products, they have proven to be unsurpassed for quality and flavor. Once I've tried their teas they immediately became my drink of choice. <p>The Zen Green Tea Blend is a wonderful one that has only a few ingredients with no artificial anything. And thankfully, doesn't boast the addition of fortified vitamins in some senseless amount. It truly is an enlightening blend of green tea, spearmint, lemongrass and lemon verbena. Thus making it versatile refreshment for anytime of the day, whether it's right after meals or between meals, or just before bedtime. Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever! I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being? I think it just could be the great taste and aroma and probably the reassuring thought of doing your health a favor.<br />Try a couple of their teas - they are sure to please!<br />And Tazo Zen Green Tea makes a good choice.\n",

She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys, especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.  She love jumping high to pop them.<p>So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty, you might try these.\n",

      "Prince of Wales tea is my Favorite Tea of all time.  It is a blend of China Keemun and just a dash of Lapsang Souchong.  The Keemun is a lovely smooth tasting tea, and the Lapsang Souchong adds just a hint of smoky flavor.  I drink it all the time.  I would recommend Prince of Wales to anyone who enjoys a Good cup of hot tea.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is that I could purchse it in a larger container.\n",

      "For me, when the days get colder nothing is as rewarding as a simple cup of hot tea. And for it's claimed immunity benefits, a basic green tea is a common pick for maintaining a healthy natural balance during the flu season. From previous experiences in tasting the Tazo brand, both of the bottled and boxed products, they have proven to be unsurpassed for quality and flavor. Once I've tried their teas they immediately became my drink of choice. <p>The Zen Green Tea Blend is a wonderful one that has only a few ingredients with no artificial anything. And thankfully, doesn't boast the addition of fortified vitamins in some senseless amount. It truly is an enlightening blend of green tea, spearmint, lemongrass and lemon verbena. Thus making it versatile refreshment for anytime of the day, whether it's right after meals or between meals, or just before bedtime. Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever! I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being? I think it just could be the great taste and aroma and probably the reassuring thought of doing your health a favor.<br />Try a couple of their teas - they are sure to please!<br />And Tazo Zen Green Tea makes a good choice.\n",

They taste great and are filling enough to stop a more \"sinful\" snack-attack cold. Eat one of these before you start searching the supermarket aisles, and you'll save quite a bit on those hunger-driven impulse buys. This is an excellent, healthy product.\n",

      "This is a  beautiful repackaging of Camper Van Beethoven's first three albums, plus a bunch of miscellaneous stuff. Each CD comes in a little cardboard cover just like the original record, which is sort of thrilling. To me, these three albums were, by far, the most exciting music Camper Van Beethoven ever released. After the 3rd album, they got caught up in that unfortunate late-80s quality pop songcraft thing, and it broke them. This stuff, though, is tossed out, sloppy, unprofessional, fun, and gorgeous. Don't get all that other stuff, get this.\n",

      "Clearly this is a subjective matter since I'm in disagreement with previous reviewers.  But while I have at least enjoyed, even loved other coffee varieties in the Tassimo machine, I hated the Gevalia Morning Roast so much I threw the rest away after making several attempts to tolerate it.  It was terribly weak, almost chemical-tasting; it tastes like what comes out of a traditional drip coffee maker if you forget to replace the used grounds with fresh ones.  (For the record, my favorites are the Starbucks House Blend and Colombian; Seattle's Best Henry's Blend is milder, less flavorful than those but still a decent cup of coffee, and cheaper than the Starbucks; Starbucks Verona is too strong for my taste.)\n",

My son had sent a Briel Cadiz Espresso machine, two lovely Russian china cups and a case of Espressione Classic Espresso Pods.  It was the kindest, most wonderful Christmas present I can remember.  The espresso machine excels in quality and ease of use.  The espresso is exquisite.  Each time I prepare an espresso or cappuccino I experience my son's loving kindness and a small part of the many gifts of Italy.  Heaven on Earth.\n",

      "This sausage tastes fine.  It tastes a little like spam but without the yucky .  I'm using this as a cured meat in veggie dishes that call for a pork component so it is fine but it doesn't have a delicious sausage flavor  to it but a milder salty pork product taste. A 12 ounce can of spam is about Two Dollars so this clean tasting product is a much better choice.<br /><br />This meat was excellent in a heated baguette with cream cheese smeared and a generous amount of cilantro/coriander.  It hit the same notes as a Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwich without the concern over what zactly is in that inexpensive pate.  I don't eat sausage very often and I probably won't buy any more for a long time.<br /><br />This sausage is at least 50% fat nubbins. The other sausage I bought is also very fatty so these are good to have around if you need lard in a recipe.\n",

      "I bought the Raisin Brown Bread today on a whim at the grocery store (Publix in Florida) and I really liked it. Of special interest to me was the fact that no refined white sugar is used to sweeten it (only molasses) and no white flour is used (only whole wheat and rye flours). This bread is therefore quite closer to a South Beach Diet-acceptable &quot;dessert&quot; versus something you'd get in a typical bakery (with the possible exception of the molasses...didn't read that far).<p>The raisins were sweet and delicious and the bread is rich and hearty. I paid $1.99 locally and found it to be a very good value. It was flavorful and delicious enough by itself that butter actually was a negative when I tried it! That doesn't happen often.<p>I would recommend you try this product at least once to see what you think. I think it would be great to keep on hand as a snack, as one can could easily last you a few days of snacking.\n",

The pastes mix very well with frosting (I have not used them for anything else yet).

However, when purchasing it over the internet and having it shipped to your residence.. that's another thing. First off UPS can't find their way even with GPS.. so I didn't receive my 4.4lbs of candy until a week after it had arrived at the wrong address.. When I opened it, it was 4.4lbs of solid chocolate in two individual bags.<br /><br />USE extreme caution when ordering this stuff over the internet!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "See's Candies is a well-known San Francisco chocolate company, now with stores throughout the United States.  In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<p>Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box.\n",

I figured it was too good to be true to get so much for the price - the good ones are very pricey. Instead of the delicious syrup they're supposed to have, these had that gross donut glaze. I tried to pawn these off to my little brother and his friends (they've never tried real marrons glaces) and they didn't even like these for what they are!

The best way to enjoy it is on toast points with slices of strawberry, the tang and sweetness of the berries accenting and enhancing the cheese's saltiness.
